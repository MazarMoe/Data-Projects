## 💼 About Me
I'm a Data Analyst passionate about both the **analytics** and **engineering** side of things.
I love working with data to find insights that matter, and transforming it into visuals and narratives that tell a story.  

I'm also equally fascinated by the **engineering systems** that power data workflows and am currently diving deeper into **data engineering**.  
I plan to post more projects as I continue learning and building my data engineering skills. 🚀
